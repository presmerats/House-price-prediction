ok-review framework

- adapt to framework
	ok- 04_XXXX for models
	ok- 02_XXXX for feature selection/extraction
	ok- 03_XXXX for unsupervised learning
	ok. adapt preprocessing
	- adapt ridge and lasso 
		ok- and add to aux_functions.R
		ok- group scripts, 
		- adapt to single file input, single file output
		- write results to txdt file
		- xlsx file also?
	- clean unused R script files
