ok-review framework

ok- cross validation lab review

- adapt to framework
	ok- 04_XXXX for models
	ok- 02_XXXX for feature selection/extraction
	ok- 03_XXXX for unsupervised learning
	ok. adapt preprocessing
	- adapt ridge and lasso 
		ok- and add to aux_functions.R
		ok- group scripts, 
		- datapreparation
			ko- adapt the outputs to different calls to different files
			ok- review datapreparation_short2
				Inspection
				Missing data
				Outliers
					Histograms
					Mahalanobis (review if its correct)
					Saving data
				Date to montth
				Range vars (from continuous)
				Binary vars
				Ratios
				Logarithms
				Statistical analysis
					Gaussianization
				Feature Selection
					Correlation manual analysis
					Prepared Featuresets -> each one should be a differentt function
					PCA -> not implementated
			ok- create a EDA script from that
				-> remove file daving from 02_datapreparation?
				-> save to 01_EDA.R
				-> should contain PCA also
			ok- create a function with all different selections 
				-allnew
				-orig_no_outliers
				-ratios
				-logs
				-logratios
				-manual_no_correlation_selection

			ok- test everything

			- remove 02_datapreparation_short2.R


		- adapt to single file input, single file output
			- modify model fitting + prediciton inside modle function to be called inside cv
			single ridge
			single lasso
			call from main
		- write results to txdt file
		- xlsx file also?
	- clean unused R script files

- train basic
	 models: lin, poly, ridge, lasso
	 features: pca, log, corr.

- documentation
	- skeleton
	- basic sections and ideas
	- automatically build tables from results

- train advanced:
	features: 
		clustering with Gower
	models: 
		splines, 
		GAM, 
		PCR, 
		PLS, 
		rvm, 
		neural network, 
		bayesian regression,
