			introduction


			multivariate data analysis
				preprocessing
					missing
					outliersÂ¡
				Exploratory data analysis
					histograms
					gaussianization
					extact: ratios logs 
					correlation analysis
				unsupervised analysis
					PCA
OK  				clustering
						hierarchical + kmeans
						break dataset into different clusters based on centroid/similarity
						train different models for each new dataset, predict different model for each dataset
				Assumptions
OK					normality
OK					independence
OK					homoscedasticity
					-> more than one gaussian?
??					other assumptions for each model

			feature extraction
				manual: ratios, logs (followin intuition)
				manual correlation: subsets of uncorrelated analysis
				PCA:


			fitting models
				methodology
					for each model
						justification, assumptions
						configuration of hyper parameters -> cv or other
						extraction of va error and test error
					final selection: va error, then compare with the test error

				linear
					justification:
						baseline
					model conf & hyper parameters

??				polynomial
					justification
					model selection

				ridge:

				lasso

				PCR

				decision trees

				random forest

				other
					Splines
					GAMS
					RVM

			Experiments
??				different strategy options:
					1) EDA+ assumptions; feature select; model select
					2) EDA+assumptions; pick a model based on assumpts; feature selection
					3) EDA+assumptions; PCA feature selection(get PC's); model selection; feature selection
					4) EDA+assumptions; pick BASELINE MODEL (linear regre?); feature selection; model selectioin
					5) do 1,2,3,4 and compare the results
				implementation
					ok-pca extraction
					ok-model selection
					ok- write model output to another file? or use another identifier
					ok-feature selection

					ok-feature selection from all datasets in a folder
					implement 3
					implement 1
					implement 2
					implement 4
					implement 5
					explain each of them

					fix CV (train and predict, refit after cv )
					
					other feature sets
						use sampling to select columns and write to a file
					EXECUTE FEATURE/MODEL SELECTION AGAIN?
				
				*	results table from csv
					plot from csv
				
					eda plots and charts (histograms, logs, ratios,)


				feature selection:
					Experiments to select features
						manual subsets
						manual uncorrelated subsets
						pca features
						-> compare for each model?

					Experiments to fit models
						for each "selected subset"


				Results
					model va error by feature set

					featureset by model



			Conclusions
				results best models, bests featuresets
				assumptions that didnt work, relaxed?
				expectations of features vs reality?
