\section{House Prices Prediction}
Since forever, houses were the most desirable purchase in humans' lifetime. Prices of houses determined by many factors since houses differs in many aspects such as location, size, condition etc. In 2016, around 5.45 million of existing houses were sold in the U.S.\cite{statista} and there is a steady rise in sales after the "Subprime mortgage crisis" drop in sales in 2008 (Full statistics in Appendix:\ref{appendix:House sales}). With more 5.45 million transactions per year just in the U.S., without taking into account the new houses transactions, Predicting house prices is a hot and interesting topic.

\section{The Dataset}
The "House Sales in King County, USA" dataset published in Kaggle\cite{DB}. It contains 21613 observations with 19 house features and the predication attribute "Price".
Aside of "Date" feature, all of the features are numeric. However, there are some features that we might need to pre-process. Latitude and Longitude, for example, are two features that we might consider pre-process them to one composed feature that will represent the distance from the city center.
Full features table in Appendix:\ref{appendix:Features table}.
